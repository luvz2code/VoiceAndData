the af-app-eeo package should contain the eeo_site08 content
9:39 PM
/etrade/pkgs/linux/intel/af_app_eeo/20161115.0/templates/eeo_site08
the package itself yes
but I don't see the root
sorry
no there's no file in package itself

its look the package is not created with eeo_site08.. we need to call SCM team
9:39 PM
Varadarajan, Selvam

:(
9:40 PM
Tran, Nhan

it is the same package deployed on UAT
why would it be different ?
9:40 PM

yep
same package
9:43 PM
Tran, Nhan

aless they doing many re-build packages
9:43 PM
Tran, Nhan

and never sync to the correct
let me do a force on 1 node
sometimes scm script sync got lazy
9:43 PM
Tran, Nhan

Veera, are you able to confirm on the packaging for the esp service ?
9:44 PM
Sira, Amardeep

Rajeev,
force package again, still don't see it

Tran, Nhan

gme few mins
9:46 PM
Chandu, Veera

getting hold of scmteam for the af_app_eeo pkg issue
9:46 PM
Varadarajan, Selvam

why it would be there on UAT but not available on prod ?
if it is same package
can you check md5 ?
9:47 PM
1. they patched - manually
2. they download the pkg from another pkg-server
I tried one of the main one -adm1m7

Chandu, Veera

thanks Veera
let me re-roll set 1 espsvc
9:50 PM
Tran, Nhan

unfortunately the crc and eeo svc's are codeploying on same node
and their uat testing will get affected if changes dont go on time
9:50 PM
Chandu, Veera
the better soln may be to pull the eeo svc's on to different new instance.
